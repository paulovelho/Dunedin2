“Mr. Trout,” I said, “I am a novelist, and I created you for use in my books.” “Pardon me?” he said. “I’m your Creator,” I said. “You’re in the middle of a book right now—close to the end of it, actually.” “Um,” he said. “Are there any questions you’d like to ask?” “Pardon me?” he said. “Feel free to ask anything you want—about the past, about the future,” I said. “There’s a Nobel Prize in your future:” “A what?” he said. “A Nobel Prize in medicine.” “Huh,” he said. It was a noncommittal sound. “I’ve also arranged for you to have a reputable publisher from now on. No more beaver books for you.” “Um,” he said. “If I were in your spot, I would certainly have lots of questions,” I said. “Do you have a gun?” he said.

“Are you crazy?” he said. “No,” I said. And I shattered his power to doubt me. I transported him to the Taj Mahal and then to Venice and then to Dar es Salaam and then to the surface of the Sun, where the flames could not consume him—and then back to Midland City again. The poor old man crashed to his knees. He reminded me of the way my mother and Bunny Hoover’s mother used to act whenever somebody tried to take their photographs.

Left alone, my crazy brain (crazy only in this area by the way) would find some excuse to do the unthinkable: drink and drugs. In the face of decades of my life having been ruined by doing this, I’m terrified of doing it again. I have no fear of talking in front of twenty thousand people, but put me alone on my couch in front of a TV for the night and I get scared. And that fear is of my own mind; fear of my own thoughts; fear that my mind will urge me to turn to drugs, as it has so many times before.

At one point the teachers put my desk facing the wall at the back of the classroom because I talked so much and spent all my time trying to make people laugh. One teacher, Dr. Webb, said, “If you don’t change the way you are, you’ll never amount to anything.” (Should I admit that when I got the cover of People magazine I had a copy of it sent to Dr. Webb with a note that read, “I guess you were wrong”?

Within fifteen minutes, all the alcohol was gone. The Murrays were puking around me, and I just lay in the grass, and something happened to me. That thing that makes me bodily and mentally different from my fellows occurred. I was lying back in the grass and the mud, looking at the moon, surrounded by fresh Murray puke, and I realized that for the first time in my life, nothing bothered me. The world made sense; it wasn’t bent and crazy. I was complete, at peace. I had never been happier than in that moment. This is the answer, I thought; this is what I’ve been missing. This must be how normal people feel all the time. I don’t have any problems. It is all gone. I don’t need attention. I am taken care of, I am fine.

Years later, my father, too, would take his own meaningful walk: he had had a bad night on the drink where he fell through some bushes or something, and he talked to Debbie about it the following morning and she said, “Is this the way you want to live your life?” And he said, no—then he went for a walk and quit drinking and hasn’t had a drop since. Excuse me? You went for a walk and quit drinking? I have spent upward of $7 million trying to get sober. I have been to six thousand AA meetings. (Not an exaggeration, more an educated guess.) I’ve been to rehab fifteen times. I’ve been in a mental institution, gone to therapy twice a week for thirty years, been to death’s door. And you went for a fucking walk? I’ll tell you where you can take a walk. But my dad can’t write a play, star on Friends, help the helpless. And he doesn’t have $7 million to spend on anything. Life has its trade-offs, I suppose.

“I’m going to tell you a story and it’s going to help you,” he said. “When a woman comes over to your place, and she takes her shoes off, you are going to get laid. If she leaves them on, you won’t.” I was eighteen then; I am fifty-two now; and he has been right 100 percent of the time. There have been times I’ve cheated a little and left a pair of shoes at my doorstep as a kind of hint that this is where the shoes go. But that therapist’s insight has been correct every single time—if a woman keeps her shoes on, it’s a make-out session at best.)

18 Eles o enfrentaram, dizendo: “Não cabe a você, Uzias, queimar incenso ao SENHOR. Isso é trabalho dos sacerdotes, dos descendentes de Arão que são consagrados para esse fim. Saia do santuário, pois você transgrediu e foi infiel, e o SENHOR Deus não o honrará”. 19 Uzias ficou indignado com os sacerdotes e se recusou a deixar o incensário que estava segurando. Então na mesma hora, na presença deles, diante do altar de incenso no templo do SENHOR, a lepra apareceu na sua testa! 20 Quando o sumo sacerdote Azarias e os outros viram a lepra, expulsaram Uzias imediatamente do templo! Ele mesmo se apressou em sair dali porque o SENHOR o havia ferido. 21 Assim, o rei Uzias ficou leproso até o dia de sua morte, e viveu sozinho, separado de sua gente e do templo do SENHOR.

If, gentle reader, you’re imagining that’s how I got Friends, you might want to cool your jets. That call led to the show that almost stopped me from getting Friends. L.A.X. 2194 was a “sci-fi comedy” about baggage handlers at Los Angeles International Airport. You could really stop there, but there’s more: those numbers in the title give away the twist—it was set two hundred years in the future, and the air travelers would be aliens. The show would star Ryan Stiles as an automaton office manager with a weird accent (seriously, Ryan is a hilarious actor, but what was that accent?), and me as the poor guy who had to be the lead in this mess and sort out the baggage issues for the arriving aliens, who happen to have been played by Little People in ridiculous wigs.

a script for a new show called Friends Like Us became the hot read of the season. Everyone who read it knew it was going to be great; I read it and immediately called those same agents who’d gotten me L.A.X. 2194. “You have to get me on Friends Like Us,” I said. “Not gonna happen,” my agents said. “You’re attached to the baggage handlers show. They’ve already measured you for the futuristic shirt and everything.” I was devastated. When I read the script for Friends Like Us it was as if someone had followed me around for a year, stealing my jokes, copying my mannerisms, photocopying my world-weary yet witty view of life. One character in particular stood out to me: it wasn’t that I thought I could play “Chandler,” I was Chandler. But I was also Blaine in L.A.X. 2194. Fuck me, is everyone kidding? Am I the least lucky person on the planet? It only got worse. Because Friends Like Us was the hot ticket of the season, everyone was reading it, everyone was auditioning for it, and everyone, it seemed, decided that the part of Chandler was exactly like me and came to my apartment to ask me to help them with their auditions.

Out of nowhere, I found myself getting to my knees, closing my eyes tightly, and praying. I had never done this before. “God, you can do whatever you want to me. Just please make me famous.” Three weeks later, I got cast in Friends. And God has certainly kept his side of the bargain—but the Almighty, being the Almighty, had not forgotten the first part of that prayer as well. Now, all these years later, I’m certain that I got famous so I would not waste my entire life trying to get famous. You have to get famous to know that it’s not the answer. And nobody who is not famous will ever truly believe that.

Those eight broken ribs were, by the way, much the same injury that the New Orleans Saints’ quarterback Drew Brees suffered in a game in November 2021 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

it isn’t unheard of for an actor to fuck up a table read so badly that they were politely asked to leave before a minute of shooting took place. But that would be tomorrow—for now, Jimmy took the six of us to Monica’s apartment set and told us just to talk to each other. And so we did—we talked and joked, about romance, our careers, our loves, our losses. And the bond that Jimmy knew would be critical had begun. The six of us ate lunch together, outside on a beautiful spring day. As we ate, Courteney—the only established name of the group back then—said, “There are no stars here. This is an ensemble show. We’re all supposed to be friends.” Given her status—she’d been on Family Ties and in Ace Ventura and in a guest spot on Seinfeld and had danced with Bruce Springsteen in the video for “Dancing in the Dark”—she could have been everything and everybody; she could easily have said “I’m the star.” Hell, she could have had her lunch somewhere else, and we would have to have been fine with it. Instead, she simply said, “Let’s really work and get to know each other.” She said it’s what she’d noticed about how it worked on Seinfeld, and she wanted it to be true about Friends, too. So we did what she suggested. From that first morning we were inseparable. We ate every meal together, played poker.… At the start, I was full-on the joke man, cracking gags like a comedy machine whenever I could (probably to the annoyance of everyone), trying to get everybody to like me because of how funny I was. Because, why else would anybody like me? It would take fifteen years for me to learn that I didn’t need to be a joke machine.

When I first read the script, I knew it was different because it was so character driven and smart. But early on, Matt LeBlanc was concerned that because he was this kinda cool, macho, ladies’ man in the script, Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe wouldn’t be friends with him, wouldn’t like him that much, and that made his character less believable.

That day in my dressing room, he sat down opposite me and started in. “Matty,” he said, “I’ve been thinking. When we renegotiate our contracts, we should do it as a team. We should all get paid the same amount.” He was by far the one in the best position to negotiate. I could not believe what he was saying. Needless to say, I was thrilled. I was perfectly happy to take advantage of his generosity of spirit. It was a decision that proved to be extremely lucrative down the line. David had certainly been in a position to go for the most money, and he didn’t. I would like to think that I would have made the same move, but as a greedy twenty-five-year-old, I’m not sure I would have. But his decision served to make us take care of each other through what turned out to be a myriad of stressful network negotiations, and it gave us a tremendous amount of power. By season eight, we were making a million dollars per episode; by season ten we were making even more. We were making $1,100,040 an episode, and we were asking to do fewer episodes. Morons, all of us. We had David’s goodness, and his astute business sense, to thank for what we had been offered. I owe you about $30 million, David. (We were still morons.)

Dating Julia Roberts had been too much for me. I had been constantly certain that she was going to break up with me—why would she not? I was not enough; I could never be enough; I was broken, bent, unlovable. So instead of facing the inevitable agony of losing her, I broke up with the beautiful and brilliant Julia Roberts. She might have considered herself slumming it with a TV guy, and TV guy was now breaking up with her. I can’t begin to describe the look of confusion on her face.

I didn’t have to worry about fucking that up—I was clean, and I was about to have my season, the one where everyone was talking about Chandler. (Nine was the only year I was completely sober for a Friends season. Care to hazard a guess as to which was the only year I got nominated for an Emmy for best actor in a comedy? Yup, season nine. If that doesn’t tell you something, nothing will. What did I do differently that season? I listened. I didn’t just stand there and wait for my turn to speak. Sometimes in acting, it’s more powerful to listen than to talk. I have tried to incorporate that in real life, too. Know more, say less. That’s my new mantra.)

But there was no fourth wall to break; there never had been, in fact. We had been in people’s bedrooms and living rooms for a decade; in the end, we were an integral part of so many people’s lives that what we’d missed was that there had never been a fourth wall to break in the first place.

Before that final episode, I’d taken Marta Kauffman to one side. “Nobody else will care about this except me,” I said. “So, may I please have the last line?” That’s why as we all troop out of the apartment, and Rachel has suggested one last coffee, I got to bring the curtain down on Friends. “Sure,” Chandler said, and then, with perfect timing, for the very last time, “Where?”

Aaron runs a very tight ship—that’s just how he likes it—to the point where there was someone on set with a script making sure that if the original reads “he is angry” and I, or someone else, shortened it to “he’s angry,” we’d have to reshoot the entire scene—it had to be done exactly as written.

2 Os homens de Israel casaram-se com mulheres dessas nações pagãs e as tomaram por esposas de seus filhos. Dessa maneira, o povo santo de Deus se misturou através desses casamentos mistos; e os líderes e oficiais foram os primeiros a se tornarem infiéis. 3 Quando ouvi isto, fiquei tão chocado que rasguei a minha túnica e o meu manto, arranquei os cabelos da cabeça e da barba e me assentei completamente desorientado. 4 Então todos os que tremiam diante das palavras do Deus de Israel se assentaram comigo por causa da infidelidade dos exilados. E eu permaneci assentado, atônito, até o sacrifício da tarde.

It’s not like the Amy Winehouse story, where she was sober for a while, and then the first drinks she had killed her. She said something in that documentary that is true for me, too. She had just won a Grammy and she said to a friend, “I can’t enjoy this unless I’m drunk.” The idea of being famous, the idea of being rich, the idea of being me—I can’t enjoy any of it unless I’m high.

This disease … the big horrible thing. Addiction has ruined so much of my life it’s not funny. It’s ruined relationships. It’s ruined the day-to-day process of being me. I have a friend who doesn’t have any money, lives in a rent-controlled apartment. Never made it as an actor, has diabetes, is constantly worried about money, doesn’t work. And I would trade places with him in a second. In fact, I would give up all the money, all the fame, all the stuff, to live in a rent-controlled apartment—I’d trade being worried about money all the time to not have this disease, this addiction. And not only do I have the disease, but I also have it bad. I have it as bad as you can have it, in fact.

Naquele dia, enquanto o Livro de Moisés foi lido em voz alta, achou-se escrito nele que não se deveria permitir que os amonitas e os moabitas se juntassem ao povo de Deus, 2 porque eles não tinham sido bondosos com o povo de Israel, não dando água e comida aos israelitas. Em vez disso, tinham contratado Balaão para amaldiçoar o povo. Porém, Deus transformou a maldição em bênção. 3 Quando o povo ouviu esta lei, todos os estrangeiros foram excluídos de Israel.

One study looked specifically at what happens when education and science knowledge butt heads with political dogmatism. It found that “more knowledgeable individuals are more likely to express beliefs consistent with their religious or political identities for issues that have become polarized along those lines (e.g. stem cell research, human evolution), but not for issues that are controversial on other grounds (e.g. genetically modified foods).” So for controversial science-related issues that were not politically polarized, more education meant less dogmatism—which seems intuitive. But when the science-related controversies were politically (or religiously) polarized, that correlation went away, and their beliefs simply lined up with their tribal alliance. In our terms: well-educated people are likely to be high-rung thinkers…until the topic is politically or religiously polarized, at which point they drop down the ladder and become obedient partisans like anybody else.

Storytelling is inherently dangerous. Consider a traumatic event in your life. Think about how you experienced it. Now think about how you told it to someone a year later. Now think about how you told it for the hundredth time. It’s not the same thing. Most people think perspective is a good thing: you can figure out characters arcs, you can apply a moral, you can tell it with understanding and context. But this perspective is a misrepresentation: it’s a reconstruction with meaning, and as such bears little resemblance to the event.

Beyond protecting against tyranny, free speech laws open the gates to a dynamic free speech market—the marketplace of ideas. In the marketplace of ideas, scientists freely do their research, philosophers freely philosophize, activists freely protest, journalists freely report, and artists and comedians freely challenge norms and test the edges of what’s socially acceptable. If the market’s “supply” is made up of the ideas of millions of free-speaking humans, “demand” consists of millions of free-listening ears. To win the key currency of the market—attention and influence—ideas have to out-compete other ideas in the market.

O humor tem essa capacidade de estabelecer uma distância “entre nós e nós mesmos”, como diz o comediante Ricardo Araújo Pereira. Ele nos obriga a ver a situação por outro ângulo, o que “não altera a natureza da ação, mas sim o modo de a perceber, como quando damos um passo atrás diante de um quadro e vemos pormenores que, tendo estado sempre na tela, não tínhamos sido capazes de captar”.

O comediante H. J. Benjamin não teve medo de errar – ao contrário, fez dos erros o mote de seu álbum de jazz, que gravou sem saber tocar nenhum instrumento. Ele convidou um grupo de profissionais para compor a banda, com bateria, baixo e saxofone, postando-se ao piano, e o resultado não poderia ser mais divertido: ouvimos a harmoniosa integração entre os músicos até que, de repente, entra um piano completamente fora de tom, tocando notas desencontradas.

Uma coisa é engraçada quando – de alguma forma que não seja realmente ofensiva ou assustadora – perturba a ordem estabelecida. Toda piada é uma pequena revolução. Se você tivesse que definir o humor em uma única frase, poderia defini-lo como a dignidade sentada numa tachinha. Qualquer coisa que destrua a dignidade e derrube os poderosos dos seus assentos, de preferência com uma pancada, é engraçada. E quanto mais do alto eles caem, maior é a piada. Traria mais diversão atirar uma torta num bispo do que num cura.

Lindsay Shepherd, a teaching assistant at Wilfrid Laurier University, ended up in hot water after she played, for her class, five minutes of a TV debate with clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson about legal issues around gender pronouns and free speech. 105 A student complaint landed Shepherd in a meeting with school diversity officials (which she recorded), where she was reprimanded for creating “an unsafe learning environment for students.” When Shepherd said that she had “remained very neutral” in class, she was told, “That’s kind of the problem.” 106 Shepherd’s experience is not uncommon. A Brandeis professor was the subject of a long investigation for saying the racial slur “wetback” while explaining its use as a pejorative. Duquesne University went a step further and actually fired a professor for saying a racial slur in a pedagogical context (he was talking about how the word has become more taboo over time). A USC professor was removed from his position after saying a Chinese filler word that sounds like an English slur during a lesson about filler words in different languages. A University of Illinois Chicago law professor was placed on leave for including censored references to two slurs (literally, "N_____" and "B____") in an exam hypothetical about workplace discrimination. ⬥ The month after George Floyd’s death, a white UCLA student emailed their professor recommending that, due to the tragedy, students of color receive extended deadlines and a shortened final exam. The professor sent a response explaining why he saw such a policy as impractical, and the student posted the email online. Twenty thousand petition signatures later, UCLA suspended the professor.

Students are pressured to conform their opinions to those broadly associated with their race and gender and to minimize or dismiss individual experiences that don’t match those assumptions. The morally compromised status of “oppressor” is assigned to one group of students based on their immutable characteristics.

6 Certo dia, eu estava observando, da janela de minha casa, 7 e vi um jovem sem juízo, sem a menor noção do que é certo e errado. 8 Ele vinha pela rua, junto à casa de certa mulher, andando de lá para cá, próximo da casa dela. 9 Era ao anoitecer, as sombras da noite se aproximavam, crescia a escuridão. 10 A mulher saiu para se encontrar com ele; ela era bem ousada, e com muita malícia tentou provocar o jovem com suas roupas de prostituta. 11 Ela era vulgar e atrevida, uma mulher que nunca para em casa; 12 ora está na rua, ora nas praças, ora nas esquinas, à espreita de homens para serem seus amantes. 13 Ela se aproximou do jovem, beijou-o e disse muito cinicamente: 14 “Tenho em casa a carne das ofertas de paz34 que hoje preparei no templo para cumprir meus votos. 15 Por isso vim procurá-lo e de repente você apareceu! 16 Minha cama está coberta com lindos lençóis de linho colorido, importados do Egito. 17 Minha cama está perfumada com mirra, aloés e canela. 18 Venha, vamos nos embriagar de carícias até o amanhecer; gozemos das delícias do amor! 19 Meu marido não está em casa, saiu para uma longa viagem 20 e, pela quantidade de prata que levou, não voltará antes da lua cheia”. 21 Assim, ela seduziu o jovem com suas palavras e o atraiu com sua conversa doce e mentirosa. 22 Imediatamente ele a acompanhou, como um boi que caminha para o matadouro, ou como a corça35 que cai numa armadilha 23 e espera apenas a morte quando a flecha lhe atravesse o fígado, ou como um pássaro que entra no alçapão sem saber que nunca sairá vivo de lá.
